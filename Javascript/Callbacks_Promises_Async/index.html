    <!-- Synchronuos 
    => Synchronuos means the code runs in a particular sequence of intsructions given in the program. 
       Each intsruction waits for the previous intsruction to complete its execution

    Asynchronuos
    => Due to Synchronuos programming, sometimes imp instruction get blocked due to some privious instruction,
      which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronuos code execution allows to execute next instrutions immediately and doesnt block the flow
       
    Callbacks
    => A callback is a function passes as an argument to another function
